# Leyna's Personal Website ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my personal website repository! This project was created using React, and it marks my first journey into the world of React development. I followed an insightful tutorial provided by GreatStack on YouTube, which you can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag1LsgIUc0).

## Technologies Used

- **React**: This project is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It gave me a structure to create a dynamic single-page website.

- **JavaScript**: JavaScript was used as the main programming language used for handling dynamic content, user interactivity, and form validation.

- **CSS**: CSS was employed for styling and layout, including adding personalized touches to the website and a cool-looking gradient!

- **EmailJS**: The contact form is powered by EmailJS, allowing integration with my email and enabling users to get in touch easily.

- **GitHub Pages**: I'm using GitHub Pages to host this website.

- **Node Package Manager**: Node Package Manager was used as the package manager for this project including installation, dependency management, and interaction from the command line.

## Features

- **Contact Form**: The website features a contact form powered by EmailJS, providing a convenient way for any visitors to get in touch with me.

- **Resume**: My resume PDF is linked in my website's NavBar, making it accessible to anyone who is interested in downloading it from my website.

- **Personalized Sections**: I added custom sections to the website, tailoring it to showcase my work experience, skills, resume, and projects.

## Learning Experience

Creating this website has been a great learning experience! Throughout the development process, I gained valuable insights into:

- **React Development**: I delved into the fundamentals of React, including components, state management, and different libraries.

- **JavaScript**: Working on the website allowed me to learn basic JavaScript, including handling user interactions and data.

- **CSS Styling**: I experimented with CSS to achieve a visually appealing and personalized design, implementing the gradient and ensuring a responsive layout both in desktop and mobile devices.

- **Node Package Manager**: This was my first time using npm. I was able to learn different commands using npm and create a React environment from scratch.
